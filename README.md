# Swift_Resources
An ever evolving list of useful resources for Swift development broken down in to sensible groupings like,

- Software
- Tutorials
- Blogs
- [Podcasts](https://github.com/GrfxGuru/Swift_Resources/blob/master/Podcasts.md)
- Resources

Please feel free to add to the lists in this repository. Swift is a great example of community and I'd love for these resources to reflect that involvement.
